  			<p>The world is a small place and there is so little time. One moves forward and you come across a mountain and then there is another one and another one. Only when you have a large field of lavender and lilacs is there essential happiness. And it is a moot point that it is impossible and it is understood well. I hope that it will be not mere philosophy that will keep the homefires burning.That gives a cue into who I am as a Sociologists- of someone who is turning into a techie.

  			<p> For the past few decades of my life I have looked at problems around me and have attempted to find solutions to them in the way that it has being done in the past. With rules of the philosophers and thinkers: all with intention and love but rather slow. Recently since I took a plunge into technology I have discovered that solutions happen like magic. 

  			They are the logic to the lilacs and lavender. One has to have the right intent and love nevertheless.

			<p>I am a User Experience Researcher who has worked with people so far to find solutions from the users' POV. I gave the user perspectives to the stakeholders in the team who found the solutions in technology- it was the designers, the developers who gave me the solutions and I loved doing what I did. 
	     
	     	However, recently I took on the task of doing it all on my own. One step at a time. I have taken on the task of learning to create and manipulate the web. Bring it on dear world.
