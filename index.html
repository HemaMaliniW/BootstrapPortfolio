		<h2>about me</h2>
       
		<p>The world is a small place and there is so little time. One moves forward and there is a mountain and then there is another one. Only when you have a large field of lavender and lilacs is there essential happiness. And it is a moot point that it is impossible and it is understood well.

	     That gives a cue into who I am as a Sociologists who is turning into a techie. It means that for the past few decades of my life I have looked at porblems around me and have attempted to find solutions to them in the way that it has being done in the past. Recently since I took a plunge into technology I have discovered that solutions happen like magic. They are the logic to the lilacs and lavender. One has to have the right intent.


	     I am a User Experience Researcher that has worked with people so far to find solutions from the users' POV. I gave these over to the stakeholders in the team who found the solutions in technology- it was the designers, the developers who gave me the solutions and I loved doing what I did. 
	      Recently I took on the task of doing it all on my own. One step at a time- bring it on.</p>
